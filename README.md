# Acme Photography fictoinal app
This app is just a training but feel free to try it.
* It's an Advanced implementation from Brad Traversey's Poject "Build a Responsive, Mobile First Website - HTML5 & CSS3"

# Build and run

* just clone the repo with `git clone` and then run

```
yarn install // if you're using yarn
// And guess what
npm install // if you're using npm
```
* It's almost pure except for scroll animation which created by this cool library. Star him he is a cool guy `https://github.com/tarun-dugar/easy-scroll`.

* I'm using parcel as a module loader and bundler so just type in `yarn/npm run dev` and the app will be running in the same port as your password
`localhost:1234`.
